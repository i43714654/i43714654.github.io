            Biodiversity is essential for maintaining the balance of ecosystems. It provides food, medicine, and ecological services such as air purification, climate regulation, and soil fertility. The rich variety of plants, animals, and microorganisms ensures the sustainability of our environment. However, human activities like deforestation and pollution threaten biodiversity, making conservation crucial for the planet's future.
